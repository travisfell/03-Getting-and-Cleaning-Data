This script contains code for the Coursera.org "Getting and Cleaning Data" final course project. It assumes: 

1. The source data files have already been downloaded (using this link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and unzipped.

2. The script and source data files reside in the working same directory.
